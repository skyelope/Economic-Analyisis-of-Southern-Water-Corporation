# Economic-Analyisis-of-Southern-Water-Corporation
I analyzed how economic factors impacted the Southern Water Corp business in a highly competitive market measuring elasticity analysis between soft and hard water products followed by a cost-effectiveness evaluation for each desalination plant and identified the best periods to perform a major outage.
## Overview

#### The Southern Water Corp. (SWC) is an Israeli water desalination company that sells fresh water for three customer segments: Residential, Public and Private. Since the demand for agricultural and residential use is rising, Southern Water Corp. needed to maximize the availability of its three desalination plants. This has resulted in increased revenue for the calendar year. While the increase in revenue is fantastic, Southern Water Corp does not want an unsustainable rise in costs.

#### In this case study, I analyzed how economic factors impacted the Southern Water Corp business in a highly competitive market.

#### In determining market price, water is traded by the mega-liters at a price known as the Water Market Balancing Price (WMBP). The WMBP is the settling price between water buyers and sellers. The WMBP is influenced by supply and demand like any other market. If there is more water demand from customers, the price should theoretically increase. The reverse also holds true – if there isn’t enough demand, the price will fall until we hit an equilibrium point where the market supply and demand are balanced. It’s important that we can understand and model these market demand factors to identify the periods where demand is highest. These periods represent the ideal opportunities to generate revenue and sell more water.  

#### With management very much aware of the tight-competition in the Desalinated Water Market, they have requested the following Economic Data Analysis 
 1) Economic Market Analysis – What trends are we able to identify when comparing the Soft Water Market versus the Hard Water Market? 
 2) Cost-Effectiveness – How cost-effective are the three (3) desalinated water plants when compared to the overall market? Are there periods where SWC is not cost-effective when compared to the overall WMBP? These are periods SWC can expect to bring in less revenue.
 3) What-If Analysis – There is an ongoing consensus within the team that the best time for SWC to perform a major desalination water outage is in the first quarter of the year. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested and validated to see if the first quarter is truly the best – or whether there exist more desirable periods to perform the major desalination water outage.
Ultimately, I unveiled an economic analysis of the Southern Water Corp, measuring elasticity analysis between soft and hard water products followed by a cost-effectiveness evaluation for each desalination plant and identified the best periods to perform a major outage.
